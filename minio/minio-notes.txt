In the digital world, data is the new oil. Having effective and scalable storage solutions is essential as data volume increases exponentially. 
Object storage is useful in situations like these. Instead of managing data as files or blocks, object storage treats data as objects. 
Every object has data, metadata, and a special identifier. 
MinIO, an open-source object storage server, is designed to store unstructured data (such as photos, videos, log files, backups, and container/VM images) with high scalability.
